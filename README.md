# Traffic Light Controller for a Two-Way Intersection

## Introduction
Managing traffic at intersections is crucial for ensuring road safety and maintaining smooth traffic flow. With the increasing number of vehicles on the road, the role of traffic lights in preventing accidents and reducing delays has become even more vital. Traffic lights provide essential structure and order, allowing drivers, cyclists, and pedestrians to intersect safely and predictably, significantly reducing chaos and improving traffic efficiency, especially during peak hours.

## Project Overview
This project focuses on designing and simulating a two-way traffic light controllerâ€”a fundamental system to manage traffic flow at a simple intersection. The controller cycles through green, yellow, and red lights in a predefined sequence, granting right of way to vehicles from each direction in an organized manner. The system employs combinational and sequential logic to ensure reliability and safety.

To implement and visualize the functioning of this traffic light system, the Logisim simulation tool was used. Logisim allows for clear visualization of how lights change and how intersection traffic flow is managed in real-time.

## Background and Importance
Traffic light systems have evolved significantly from manual operation to sophisticated automated systems. Initially, traffic signals required human intervention, which eventually gave way to electric signals controlled by automatic timers. Modern systems now leverage advanced technologies such as sensors, cameras, and artificial intelligence to dynamically adapt to real-time traffic conditions, enhancing their efficiency and responsiveness.

However, despite these technological advancements, the core principles of traffic control remain unchanged: ensuring safety and efficiency at intersections.

## Objective
The primary goal of this project is to focus on these fundamental principles by designing a simplified traffic light control system for a two-way intersection. It intentionally omits complexities such as pedestrian crossings and external sensors to clearly demonstrate basic operation logic. This foundational understanding can later serve as a basis for developing more advanced and responsive traffic management systems.
